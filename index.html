Seeking challenging long-term position in software development with opportunities for career advancement and use of extensive development experience and knowledge. 

> A passionate programmer offering comprehensive experience in software development processes. Extensive background covering 10 years of Research and Development in a variety of domains, from desktop to client-server applications. 


## Education          
* __PhD Computer Science__, Apr. 2000, _Université de Nice Sophia Antipolis_
* __Fifth year of university study in Computer Science__, Jun. 1995, _Université Nancy I_
* __Fourth year of university degree in Image Technology and Art__, Jun. 1994, _Université Paris 8_
* __Third Year of university degree in Computer Graphics__, Jun. 1993, _IUT Leonard de Vinci, Reims_
* __Two years Technical degree in Computer Science__, Jun. 1992, _IUT Léonard de Vinci, Reims_

## Senior R&D engineer
CSTB Sophia-Antipolis, 2005 - present.


Worked on several national and international projects as a technical solution provider : 

* __IITAS__ : I developed an Express to C++ generator to help read/write STEP-TAS exchange files and provide a modern object manipulation SDK. The aim of the project is go provide an industrial implementation of STEP-TAS within main thermal analysis tools used by the European Space Industry.
* __COMMUNIC__ : I developed a prototype able to mix GIS data and CAD data to help visualize the construction of a highway interchange. This research project was aimed to provide new tools and methodologies to communicate between contractors of highway and road construction projects.

Worked as a programmer and technical leader of a team of 5 to 6 members on these recent lines of development:

* __[eveBIM][]__ : A 3D visualization software build around the Building Information Model. Its architecture allows to develop different business views and tools. 
* __[eveCity][]__ : A 3D visualization software build on top of SIG data handlers * «à la» Google Earth * and transforming vectorial data into 3D representations allowing to integrate in-house or externals dynamic or static simulation results.
* __evePlayer__ : A realtime 3D visualization tool for immersive environments such as http://salle-immersive.cstb.fr but also for desktop use.
* __Expressik__ : a java based EXPRESS to C++ generator.
* __OLMS__ : Server side license management tool used to manage licenses and authorize client side software activation.

## R&D engineer, CSTB Sophia-Antipolis 2000-2005
Worked on several European Projects as a technical solution provider : 

* __INTELCITIES__ : (Intelligent Cities) I was involved in the specifications and the development of the e-CityPlatform that would connect and provide inter-operable services to citizens and businesses in the domain of e-Governance. This research and technological development project aimed to pool advanced knowledge and experience of electronic government, planning systems and citizen participation from across Europe.
* __DIVERCITY__ : I was involved in the technical specifications and development of the integration of simulators and simulations results (thermal, acoustic and lighting) into a single 3D workspace. The project primarily addressed Workplace Design by developing, integrating and evaluating innovative workplace technologies for creating innovative and new workplace environments in the building industry sector. 
* __VMAN__ : (Virtual Man) I was involved in the integration of the research results into our software to use and visualize these moving characters in our real time 3D viewer. The project aimed to develop an intuitive authoring system allowing non computer specialist to create, animate, control and interact with a new generation of 3D virtual characters. These AUTONOMOUS characters were intended for use in interactive media such as games and virtual reality applications. 
* __OSMOS__ : I was the leader of the team responsible for the specification of the OSMOS services and modeling infrastructure. The project was specifically concerned with defining the working practices, processes, techniques, tools and technical infrastructure to allow the European construction industry to progress from its current position towards a large scale, computer integrated approach.
